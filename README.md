# Motion_Planning
This repository is about applying A* and D* algorithmis to a Diff Drive robot and simulating it in gazebo.
Alot of the code is common with alot of different codes outside, since this is how I am learning more about the topic itself, I will try to post everything I "borrow"

This repository will include files for simulating the robot and multiple scripts concerning motion planning.
